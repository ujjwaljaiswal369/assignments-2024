Each feature plays a role in predicting the quality of wine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fixed acidity: It affects the perceived tartness or acidity of the wine. Higher levels may contribute to a sour taste.\n",
    "* Volatile acidity: It refers to the presence of volatile acids in wine, primarily acetic acid. Higher levels can lead to a *  taste.\n",
    "* Citric acid: It contributes to the freshness and fruitiness of the wine.\n",
    "* Residual sugar: It represents the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation. It influences the wine's sweetness.\n",
    "* Chlorides: Higher chloride levels can affect the wine's taste and are associated with saltiness.\n",
    "* Free sulfur dioxide: It acts as an antioxidant and preservative. It protects the wine from oxidation and microbial spoilage.\n",
    "* Total sulfur dioxide: It represents the total amount of both free and bound sulfur dioxide. It plays a role in preserving wine and preventing spoilage.\n",
    "* Density: It indicates the density of the wine relative to water and can provide insights into the alcohol content.\n",
    "* pH: It measures the acidity or basicity of the wine. It affects the stability and microbial growth.\n",
    "* Sulphates: They act as antimicrobial agents and may contribute to the wine's aroma and taste.\n",

    "* Mean imputation: Replacing missing values with the mean of the feature. It is a simple and quick method but may lead to biased results if the missing data are not randomly distributed.\n",
    "* Median imputation: Replacing missing values with the median of the feature. It is less sensitive to outliers than mean imputation.\n",
    "* Mode imputation: Replacing missing values with the mode (most frequent value) of the feature. It is useful for categorical variables.\n",
