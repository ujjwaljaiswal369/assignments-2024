    "The purpose of grid search CV (cross-validation) in machine learning is to find the optimal hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but set by the user before training the model. Grid search CV systematically searches through a predefined grid of hyperparameters and evaluates the model's performance using cross-validation. It helps to determine the hyperparameter combination that results in the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by defining a grid of hyperparameter values for each hyperparameter of interest. It then trains and evaluates the model for every possible combination of hyperparameters in the grid. The performance metric, such as accuracy or F1 score, is calculated using cross-validation, which partitions the data into multiple subsets (folds) for training and testing. The average performance across all folds is used to assess each hyperparameter combination. The hyperparameter combination with the best performance is selected as the optimal choice."
