    "Web scraping is used for a multitude of purposes. Here are three areas where it finds practical applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Market Research: Web scraping enables businesses to gather market data, such as prices, product details, \n",
    "                    and customer reviews, from e-commerce websites. By analyzing this information, companies \n",

    "                    them make informed business decisions.\n",

    "2. Data Aggregation: Web scraping is employed to collect data from multiple websites and consolidate it into \n",
    "                     a single database or platform. News aggregators, for instance, scrape news articles from \n",
    "                     various sources and present them in one location. This allows users to access a wide range \n",
    "                     of news content without visiting multiple websites individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Financial Analysis: In the financial sector, web scraping is utilized to collect and analyze data related to stocks, \n",
    "                       commodities, or currencies. Financial institutions and investors can scrape financial websites \n",
    "                       to retrieve real-time market data, historical pricing information, and news updates. This data \n",

    "There are several methods and techniques used for web scraping, depending on the complexity of the task \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Manual Scraping: This method involves manually visiting web pages, inspecting the HTML source code, \n",

    "                    extensions. It is suitable for small-scale scraping tasks but can be time-consuming \n",
    "                    and impractical for large-scale or frequent data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regular Expression (Regex): Regular expressions are patterns used to match and extract specific \n",

    "3. HTML Parsing: HTML parsing is performed using libraries like BeautifulSoup in Python or Jsoup in Java. \n",
    "                 These libraries parse the HTML structure of a web page and provide methods to navigate, \n",

    "                 structured web pages.\n",

    "4. Web Scraping Frameworks: There are specialized web scraping frameworks such as Scrapy in Python or \n",
